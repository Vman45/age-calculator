# Contributing

Please follow the steps below to contribute and add code to the project:

1. Fork it (<https://github.com/lucasmdmartins/age-calculator/fork/>)
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b your-feature-name`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'your comment'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin your-feature-name`)
5. Create a new pull request

At this point you are waiting on approval. I like to at least comment on pull requests within 3 business days (and, typically, one business day). I may suggest some changes, improvements, or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests
* Follow the application's style
* Write a clear and concise commit message
