## Description

This is a simple app that asks the user for his/her current age and then calculates the approximate number of days based on the years the user has been alive (does not account for leap years).

## Installation and Development Setup

Since this project consists of a static page, there is no need to download/install any extra packages or software to run it. All you need is a basic browser and a text editor to render/edit the files.

Simply click on the deployed page link (listed above) with your preferred browser to render the HTML/CSS/JS and see the page, or open it with your text editor to make changes.

## Usage Example

Feel free to copy this code and use it as a reference for creating more intricate apps that collect user information directly on the browser and perform calculations with it.
